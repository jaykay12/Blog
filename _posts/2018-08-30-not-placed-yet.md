Placement season is on and it’s not easy. Not everyone is able to cope up with the environment that it creates and only those people will relate to it who have gone through all the turmoil and chaos it creates within.

It may happen that your best friend will get placed before you and even though, you are happy for him/her, it somehow creates a disturbance within. Maybe because now is the time you are serious about your career.

The point which I am trying to deduce is that, don’t stress over and don’t lose hope, even if you aren’t able to make it through in the first attempt or in the second or nth attempt. Each one of you will find your things one way or the other. Some people will find it now, some people will find it later but eventually, everyone does and settles down.

> Change your thoughts and you change your world.

At this point in time, we look around and see that everyone is trying to prove something, either to himself or to others. 1 or 2 or 3 years down the lane when you will look back and see, you will realize that everything happens for our own good.

And one thing that I would like to add, embrace the struggle. That gonna reveal a lot about you. It is going to somehow shape you. And most importantly, don’t create an environment that is stressful for others. 
Be helpful, be supportive as much as you can.
Together you all can sail through.
